# Tags

Tags help people find your videos. When they are searching for videos to watch on YouTube the search algorithm will use a number of things to help display videos to them.  Once of the things it will use is Tags. 

You should add tags that will help YouTube surface your video to potential viewers. It's the thing I see people forget about most on their videos. 

Your tags should be keywords and even phrases you think your viewers would use and would relate to your video. 

There are lots of free tools out there that can help you understand the best words and phrases to help your video be discovered.  [TubeBuddy](https://www.tubebuddy.com/techielass/githubguide) and [Vidiq](https://vidiq.com/scotlandtechie) both have free plans that you can use and get started with.
