# YouTube Video Success

A lot of effort and time goes into creating videos on YouTube, ensure you maximise the impact those videos make by following these must dos on your channel and video!  I've collected my learnings and experience from building [my own YouTube](https://youtube.com/techielass) channel. My goal here is to help those on a similar journey get the return for their efforts.
