# Description

Your description should be short and snappy.  It should contain keywords that you've also used in your [tags](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/tags/readme.md) to help with discoverability. 

You want to maximise people finding your video and your video being recommended so a good description and [tags](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/tags/readme.md) really do help.

I also always include a recommendation to another video that is related to the one that they are currently watching. You want to help the viewer find more of your content so including this recommendation can help.  Whatever video you recommend here you should also look to recommend it within the [card](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/card/readme.md) and [end screen](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/endscreen/readme.md), this really helps to emphasis to YouTube that these two videos belong together and should be recommended alongside each other.
