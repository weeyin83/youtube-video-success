# Description

Your description should be short and snappy.  It should contain keywords that you've also used in your [tags](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/tags/readme.md) to help with discoverability. 

You want to maximise people finding your video and your video being recommended so a good description and [tags](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/tags/readme.md) really do help.

I also always include a recommendation to another video that is related to the one that they are currently watching. You want to help the viewer find more of your content so including this recommendation can help.  Whatever video you recommend here you should also look to recommend it within the [card](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/card/readme.md) and [end screen](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/endscreen/readme.md), this really helps to emphasis to YouTube that these two videos belong together and should be recommended alongside each other. 

## Timestamps

Timestamps are a quick and easy thing you can do to help your viewer find the part of the video they are interested in or understand what is going to happen in the video.  For them to work you need to start off with a time stamp for 0:00 and then add a title or description.  An example would be: 

0:00 - Introduction</br>
0:20 - What does an IT department look like?</br>
4:08 - Terminology: On Prem and Cloud</br>
9:50 - My career</br>
16:16 - My role as a Cloud Advocate</br>
17:44 - Working at Microsoft</br>
20:50 - Do you need a degree?</br>

## Hashtags

Hashtags are another thing you can add in your description field to help make your videos more discoverable.  These will also show just under your video, three is the maximum you should use.
