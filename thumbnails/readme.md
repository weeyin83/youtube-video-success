# Thumbnails

Thumbnails are the first thing that people see of your video when they are searching YouTube or when YouTube recommends something to them to watch next. 

You have to grab their attention, you have to intrigue them enough with your thumbnail to make them wish to watch.  You should remember that people watch YouTube on multiple platforms, from their TV to their PC to their mobile phone.  So your thumbnail design needs to work on large screens and more importantly **SMALL** screens. 

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use bold colours and big lettering
- **Do** keep it simple, don't include to many colours, images and information
- **Do** experiment, do change it up, do change old video's thumbnails
- **Don't** tell the whole story in the thumbnail leave some information for them to discover in the video
- **Don't** use small fonts
- **Don't** put anything in the bottom right hand corner, a time stamp is often displayed there by YouTube so don't hide information in that corner of your thumbnail
- **Don't** make all your thumbnails the same, if your thumbnails are all the same a viewer might say "I've seen that video" and skip over it because they've watched a previous video with a similar thumbnail
