# End Cards

End cards are the recommendations that appear within the last 20 seconds of your video.

If your viewer makes it to the end of your video then this helps to show them another video or playlist they can head to and keep watching your content.  This is an opportunity to help them stay on your channel and watch more of the hard watched videos that you've created. 

This is also a great place to put a subscribe button,
