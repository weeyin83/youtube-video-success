# Cards

Cards are those wee informational circles that pop up within videos that can either suggest the viewer head off to watch another video, playlist, website or another channel.

These are great for helping to suggest to your video another video, or if you reference previous video you did.  The recommendation seems to be that you shouldn't put a card in teh first part of your video, but a card should appear somewhere around the 70-80% mark within your video.  The thinking behind that is you don't want your viewer to click off the video they are currently watching too early. 

As I said in the [description](https://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/description/readme.md) section I recommend a video there and then repeat that recommendation within a [card](ttps://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/card/readme.md) and [end screen](ttps://github.com/weeyin83/youtube-video-success/blob/main/endscreen/readme.md).  This really does help YouTube to recognise that these videos are linked and should be recommended together.
